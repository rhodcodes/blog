Hi, I'm Rhodri Lloyd-Evans and I'm a wannabe software developer with and interest
in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and all things
 [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

Born and raised in Mid Wales, I'm a fluent Welsh speaker and when not in front of a
computer I can sometimes be found walking up hills, and then down them again.

Rhod.dev will mostly be a collection of posts about things I learn about C#
with a dash of life stuff thrown in for good measure.

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/b994ff7b0df3).
